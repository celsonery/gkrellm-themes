This theme is to match the BlueSteel enlightenment theme... 
special thanks to this author for creating such an awesome 
enlightenment theme...

NOTE: i have included in the otherimages directory other border tops..
that are the following...

1. a blank one
2. one that has gkrellm on it(default)
3. and another that has bluesteel written on it.

so take your pick and just copy it back a directory(cp [filename] ../)
