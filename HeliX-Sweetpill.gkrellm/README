	  Welcome to the HeliX-Swetpill for Gkrellm theme series ...
This theme has been created to go with the Helix-Sweetpill for sawfish themes
for the time only the Citus, Blackcurrant and Pumkin themes are supported the   
rest of the themes will come as soon as i decide to use them :)
Anyway the most of the images have been taken from the sawfish's themes images
and hacked for use with gkrellm 
The default fonts for this themes are the artsie fonts (by tigert (http://tigert.gimp.org)) which are included at the fnt/ folder 
I suggest you to use as fonts the fonts that you are using with sawfish or
with the gtk theme's fonts that you are using 

Enjoy the theme !

Any hacks of this themeS are welcome at : n0l0G1k@sdf.lonestar.org

Special thanX goes to :
