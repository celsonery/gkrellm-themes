Thanks for downloading my theme.



The images in the pixmaps directory were used for the GkrellM XMMS Plugin.

They match the theme but I had to compile them in as there is no support 
to automatically use them at this point. 

If you like the Gkrellmms plugin you can recompile it with the images in the
 pixmaps directory for a more smooth looking GkrellM. Just move the pixmaps
 out of the way in the gkrellmms source tree and replace them with the ones 
 included. Rebuild and reinstall the plugin and your set. The buttons will be 
 used for all gkrellm themes.
 
 You can see what gkrellmms looks like with my buttons, in the screenshot
 for my E theme on e.themes.org.
 
 If you don't have the plugin and are interested it is available here :
