<FONT FACE="Verdana">Sure Thomas &#8211; looks like you&#8217;ve done a nice job =) As long as you credit myself and the original Mac theme in some sort of meaningful and honest way how can I possibly complain, right? That&#8217;s all I would ask &#8211; other than that it looks very nice.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for writing!<BR>
