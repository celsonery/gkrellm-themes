blueHeart v1.2

This is a hacked version of the original gkrellm-theme blueHeart. The
enlightenment theme has changed after the first release, so I made an
updated version of this gkrellm theme.

All work is done by h0ax (www.h0ax.org). I've only moved some png-files
around. :) Hope you like it as much as I do...


Tip: If you don't like the background in the charts, simply find another
background and rename it to 'bg_chart.png'.
