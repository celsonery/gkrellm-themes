This gkrellm theme is intended to match Bith for E and BirthGTK.
It was, in the very begining, after eMac.

This latest release will only work with versions 0.10.x of GKrellM.

It includes theming for the two plugins gkrellmms (by Sander Klein
Lebbink) and volume (by Sjoerd Simons).
Both can be found at http://gkrellm.luon.net.
