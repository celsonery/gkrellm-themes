This is just a variation on the original trublu theme.  You can simply
delete the descriptive extentions that I added to bg_chart.xxx in order to
check out the different looks.  If you run it without changing any of the
extentions then gkrellm uses its default black background, which actually
looks okay.  Maybe you can just select which one you think looks best and
post that one and whoever downloads the tarball can make up their own mind.

thanks again, Maher and I hope this isn't too much trouble.
