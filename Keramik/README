Keramik v0.2.1 for Gkrellm
SkyShadow  skyshadow@slipstream.ods.org

This theme is designed to match the KDE Keramik style so significant portions are from sceencaptures of Keramik in action.  In addition the leds are derived from the go, help, and magnify icons in the Crystal icon set.

To install, extract to your ~/.gkrellm2/themes/ directory.

Todo

In version 0.3 I will add an animated Crystal style envelope for the mail notification and some new chart backgrounds.

Enjoy!
