v0.0.8		- added a new meter for the new seti 0.7.0 plugin

v0.0.7		- minor bugfix in the default_decals.

v0.0.6		- updated this theme again, now i use the border options,
		  which make styling even mire accurate. resized some meter
		  panels and resized the top and bottom frames, now it places
		  the left, right border correctly also the two pixel shadow
		  as it used to be in the gtk and sawfish theme matches now.

v0.0.5		- changed some default krells, now the little square button
		  looks like the rest round buttons (e.g. inet0) and also the
		  drive buttons have been adjusted to the round standart view.

v0.0.4		- changed the timer and net buttons, now they look much better
		  and fit better into the 'krooks' theme itself ;) lets see if
		  they can do a much better gkrellm theme for that ;)

v0.0.3		- fixed some issues where the charts going to be blue on heavy
		  traffic. also changed the krell's for charts to be visible
		  and for the last, i changed some minor aspects of that
		  theme.

v0.0.2		- due the fact that some eazel members dislike me using the
		  name 'crux' for this theme and the fact that this theme
		  seem to look terrible i decided to recreate that one again
		  from scratch and here it is. i named this one 'krooks'.

v0.0.1		- first public release because of the 'crux' theme for
		  gtk and sawfish.
