bk10-gkrellm theme is a theme made to go with h0ax.s new Etheme
which is unreleashed on e.themes.org yet but you can find a copy of it on his
site <h0ax.org> and if you run Enlightenment you HAVE to download it and run it.
Since the theme got no name till now i give it the name of its tarball 

				Bk10

The default fonts are Tixus if you dont got em already dont worry cuz they
are already included at the fonts directory.
